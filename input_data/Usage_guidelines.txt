In this input_data folder, add your particle data set. 

The rest of code is designed to extract data from a UrQMD output dataset. 
Hence, if you are using an UrQMD dataset, upload it directly in this folder, and include the filepath in the /config/config.ini file.

If you are using a different model to obtain the particle data set, modify the src codes accordingly.
